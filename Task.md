# üîç Exploring Web Application Security with Nikto: A Step-by-Step Guide

As part of my ongoing exploration in cybersecurity, I recently ran a vulnerability scan using Nikto on a deliberately insecure web application. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to help you do the same and learn more about web application security.

## Step 1: Install Git and Perl

Before you start, make sure you have Git and Perl installed on your machine.

- **Install Git**: Download it from [gitforwindows.org](https://gitforwindows.org).
- **Install Perl**: Get it from [strawberryperl.com](https://strawberryperl.com).

## Step 2: Clone the Nikto Repository

Open Command Prompt and navigate to your desired directory, then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sullo/nikto.git
```

### Step 3: Navigate to the Nikto Directory

Move into the directory where Nikto is stored. Replace the path below with the actual path where you have Nikto installed:

```bash
cd /path/to/nikto/directory
```
### Step 4: Choose a Target URL

For this example, we will use the OWASP Juice Shop, an intentionally vulnerable web application designed for learning purposes. The publicly available instance can be accessed at:

```bash
https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
```
### Step 5: Run the Nikto Scan

To start the scan, use the following command. Replace the URL with the target you want to scan:

```bash
perl nikto.pl -h https://juice-shop.herokuapp.com
```

### Step 6: Analyze the Results

After running the Nikto scan, review the output in your terminal or command prompt. The results will list any vulnerabilities or security issues identified during the scan. This information is essential for understanding potential threats and learning how to secure web applications against common vulnerabilities.

Pay close attention to the details provided for each identified issue, including severity and suggested remediation steps.

## Conclusion

Using Nikto for web application security testing is an effective way to identify potential vulnerabilities and improve the security posture of your web server or application. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can set up Nikto, run basic scans, and analyze the results to detect security issues.

Remember, while Nikto is a powerful tool, it should be used as part of a broader security strategy that includes other testing methods and tools. Regular scanning and staying updated on the latest security threats will help you maintain a secure web environment.

For further reading and advanced usage, refer to the [Nikto documentation](https://github.com/sullo/nikto).

Happy testing!
