## Internship Details

- **Name:** Fidha Thasni N
- **Company:** CODTECHITSOLUTIONS
- **ID:** CT04DS5910
- **Domain:** Cyber Security and Ethical Hacking
- **Duration:** August 2024 - September 2024
- **Mentor:** Muzammil

### Project Overview

During my internship at CODTECHITSOLUTIONS, I am focusing on web application security, specifically through vulnerability scanning and penetration testing. My primary project involves utilizing tools like Nikto to identify and analyze security vulnerabilities within web applications.

### Project: Web Application Vulnerability Scanning with Nikto

This project involves running comprehensive vulnerability scans on web applications to identify potential security weaknesses, such as:

- **SQL Injection**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Insecure Authentication Mechanisms**
- **Outdated Software Versions**
- **Misconfigurations**

#### Objective

The objective of this project is to ensure that web applications are secure by identifying vulnerabilities and proposing mitigation strategies. By leveraging the Nikto scanning tool, I aim to contribute to the overall security posture of the applications under assessment.

#### Key Steps

1. **Setup Nikto:** Clone the Nikto repository and ensure the necessary environment (Perl, Git) is configured.
2. **Select Target:** Choose intentionally vulnerable web applications such as OWASP Juice Shop for scanning.
3. **Run Scan:** Execute Nikto scans to detect and document security vulnerabilities.
4. **Analyze Results:** Interpret the output to provide actionable insights for improving web security.

#### Key Tools and Technologies

- **Nikto**
- **Perl**
- **OWASP Juice Shop** (for testing purposes)

#### Conclusion

This project has provided me with hands-on experience in web application security, reinforcing my knowledge of ethical hacking practices. By identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, I am contributing to building more secure web applications.
